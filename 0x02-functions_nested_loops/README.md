## Functions And Nested Loops
We'll be learning
* how to nest loops within other loops
* how to create functions
* how to declare functions
* how specify function return types and argument type
* how and why to use header files

#### 0-putchar.c
This program prints `_putchar` followed by a new line

#### 1-alphabet.c
print the alphabet in lowercase followed by a new line.

#### 2-print_alphabet_x10.c
This function prints the alphabet in lowercase 10x, followed by a new line.

#### 3-islower.c
This function checks if a character is lowercase

#### 4-isalpha.c
This function checks if a character is an alphabet

#### 5-sign.c
This function prints out the sign of a number
* `+` if the number is greater than 0
* `0` if the number is zero
* `-` if the number is less than 0

#### 6-abs.c
This function computes the absolute value of an integer

#### 7-print_last_digit.c
This function prints & returns the last digit of a number

#### 8-24_hours.c
This function prints every minute of the day starting from `00:00` to `23:59`.

#### 9-time_table.c
This function prints the 9 times table

#### 10-add.c
This function add two numbers and returns the result

#### 11-print_to_98.c
This function prints all natural numbers from `n` to 98, followed by a new line

#### 100-times_table.c
This function prints the `n` times table starting with 0
> if `n` is greater than 15, or less than 0, the function does not print anything

#### 101-natural.c
This program computes and prints the sum of all the multiples of `3` or `5` below `1024`(_excluded_), followed by a new line

#### 102-fibonaccii.c
This program prints out the first 50 Fibonacci numbers, starting with `1` and `2`, then followed by a new line
* The numbers are seperated by comma, followed by a space

#### 103-fibonacci.c
This program goes through all numbers in a fibonacci sequence that do not exceed 4,000,000, then:
* find an prints out the sum of the even-valued terms
* prints a new line
